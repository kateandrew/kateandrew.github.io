          <h4><strong>Completion: </strong>August 2016</h4>
          <h4><strong>Client: </strong>Private Developer</h4>
          <p>The building, which was only a shell, was part of a larger residential development in the greater London area and required a full fit out from scratch. Kate was involved in this project from early in the design phase. The programme was tight and needed to open just over a year later. The 146 guestroom hotel also has a conference centre, fitness centre, restaurant and bar. The hotel is a part of a larger green initiative where it’s heating and cooling is providing through water from the Thames. This led to a very specialised mechanical system being installed within the building. Kate led the project management of this fit out from design through to construction and developed significantly as a project manager with this project. There was a large project team including three separate designers, technical consultants, a number separate specialists, operators, owners and the brand.</p>

          <h4><strong>Client: </strong>The Ascott Group</h4>
          <p>The reception area of the hotel in St James’ was long overdue for modernising underwent a total strip out of the existing finishes. The main challenge of this job was dealing with two separate contractors doing the demolition and refurbishment as well as the hotel’s own in-house maintenance team. The project was required to be undertaken while the hotel was still running normally which meant the works had to be split into two separate phases.</p>

          <p>The refurbishments at the Mercure Windsor Castle Hotel and the Mercure Oxford Eastgate Hotel were part of a larger series of hotel refurbishments within the brand. They both consist of very old buildings which brings its own set of unknowns and challenges along the way. The refurbishments were carried out in phases so that the hotel could remain at least 75 percent open throughout the whole project. Kate was involved during the construction phase and managed to hand over process.</p>

          <h4><strong>Client:</strong> Waterfront Auckland (Council Controlled Organisation)</h4>
          <p>The John Lysaght building was an unused factory/warehouse which has received an upgrade into an office building in the popular area of Wynyard Quarter, Auckland. While it started off as a fairly simple conversion and seismic upgrade, the challenges quickly built up once it was learnt that the ground underneath was contaminated from an old gas works in the area and the existing structural elements were found  to not be as structurally sound as expected from preliminary testing. Quick responses were necessary to gain new consents to remove the contamination and sort out the knock on effects with various services. Kate was brought into the project briefly during the tender phase and was heavily involved with the project management of the construction phase leading the day to day co-ordination with consultants and the contractor.</p>

          <p>The Westhaven Promenade is a long anticipated solution to the growing popularity of outdoor activity in the area. It introduces an important pedestrian link between the Auckland Harbour Bridge with Wynyard Quarter. Being both land based and water based the designers had to come up with a solution to ensure the structure could be built efficiently. Kate’s involvement in this project was from early on in the design phase which included engaging the consultants, right through to construction. Kate led the consenting, procurement and contract administration and played an important role in co-ordinating day to day issues as well as budget and variation management.</p>

          <p>Due to the upgrade of an adjacent street the building sat mostly empty for period of time. Kate led the project management of a new office fit out from procurement through to completion. The fit out was carried out on a tight budget as it will only to be utilised for up to 3 years until further developments are due to happen on the site. The work needed to be completed on a very short time frame and to enable this, along with gaining the necessary consents, the work had to be split into two phases.  It was successfully completed and the office space now enjoys the added bonus of the new street outside.</p>

          <p>Shed 10 is a heritage building on Queens Wharf in downtown Auckland. The shed underwent refurbishment to enable it to cater as a dry-hire space for events and to also double as a cruise terminal during the cruise season. Design challenges included the requirement to keep the building true to its heritage while upgrading it to make it useable. Kate had involvement with the project management during the design and tender phase and further involvement once the main contractor went into receivership. The change in contractor has an effect on the original completion dates which conflicted with a major event.

          <p>Karanga Plaza is the gateway into the new developments in Wynyard Quarter when approaching from the newly constructed Wynyard Crossing which opens up this area to the Viaduct (one of the main social centres of downtown Auckland). It houses the Karanga Kiosk which is an information kiosk for the quarter. The plaza encourages interaction with the water. Kate had involvement, as an assistant project manager, during the construction phase and close out phase of this project.</p>
